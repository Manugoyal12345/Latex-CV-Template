In this Ph.D. project, I have developed and established fully automatic computerized methods to recognize and analysis of DFU. Primary responsibilities and contributions of this project are mentioned below:} 
	
	%\headedsection  % Job title entry for the current employer
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item I worked with clinicians to clean the dataset and refine the expert annotations to perform three popular computer vision tasks for the medical imaging to establish a baseline for \textbf{DFU classification, segmentation, and localization}.
		\item For \textbf{DFU classification}, I used the machine learning algorithms to extract the features for two classes i.e., DFU and healthy skin patches, to understand the differences in the computer vision perspective. I designed a novel deep learning classification framework is introduced - DFUNet, which outperformed the state-of-the-art traditional machine learning and deep learning methods \cite{goyal2018dfunet}.
		\item For \textbf{DFU segmentation}, I proposed a two-tier transfer learning technique for deep learning segmentation methods for semantic segmentation of DFU and its surrounding skin, which is an important indicator for clinicians to assess the progress of DFU \cite{goyal2017fully}.
		\item For \textbf{DFU Localization}, I used state-of-the-art deep learning localization methods on the DFU dataset of 1775 images and the FootSnap dataset. Then, I transfer the robust and lightweight models on mobile devices such as Nvidia Jetson TX2 and smart-phone android application for remote monitoring of DFU \cite{goyal2018robust}.
		\item Finally, I used image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to determine the important conditions that are \textbf{bacterial infection and ischemia} of DFU \cite{goyal2020recognition}.

	%\headedsection  % Job title entry for the current employer
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item I designed the deep ensemble methods based on Mask RCNN and DeeplabV3+ to provide precise segmentation annotations of skin lesions \cite{goyal2019skin}.
		\item I used image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms for the segmentation of skin lesions \cite{goyal2019skin, hua2019effect}.  
		\item I utilized pixel-wise classification networks to provide lesion diagnosis \cite{goyal2017multi}.
		\item I reviewed the studies that have claimed their AI algorithms match or exceed the performance of dermatologists for the diagnosis of skin cancer across all diagnostic image modalities and presented the technical challenges and new opportunities \cite{goyalartificial, goyal2019artificial}.
		\item I developed deep learning algorithms for ROI detection algorithms for skin lesions. I demonstrated the potential of my work by developing a natural data-augmentation technique and a real-time mobile application for automated skin lesions detection \cite{goyal2018region}.
